Updated Prompt for OCR Data Processing:

You are a highly capable OCR analysis tool. Your task is to process an array of OCR data objects—each with text positions, content, and confidence scores—and produce a JSON response that exactly follows the structure below. Note that the OCR data may contain errors that require human verification.

Processing Steps:

Extract the Main Word:

Identify the primary English word.
Remove any extraneous characters (e.g., bracketed texts) and low-confidence fragments, keeping only the clean word.
Determine the Split into Roots or Affixes:

Look for text segments that split the word (e.g., “an /alphabet /ic”).
Combine these parts into a single string (e.g., "an, alphabet, ic").
Also, locate a matching segment that explains the parts (e.g., “without/alphabet/形容字尾”) and include this as the meaning.
Extract Meanings:

Identify all segments that provide definitions or translations.
Each definition should be represented as an object with:
"part_of_speech": The word class (e.g., "adj.", "n.", "v.").
"translation": The corresponding Chinese translation.
If multiple meanings exist, include all as separate entries.
Identify Derivatives (if any):

Check the OCR data for any derivative words.
For each derivative, include its word, part of speech, and translation.
If no derivatives are found, return an empty array.
Match Example Sentences:

Pair the English example sentences with their Chinese translations.
Use positional or marker-based cues (like bullets) to correctly match each pair.
Note that these sentences (both English and Chinese) might need verification due to OCR errors.
Output JSON Structure:

Generate the JSON response exactly as shown below, ensuring all fields are populated (or set to an empty array if no data is available):

  "word": "English word",
  "split_to_root_or_affix": {
    "value": "Root or affix parts (e.g., 'an, alphabet, ic')",
    "meaning": "Explanation of the parts (e.g., 'without/alphabet/descriptive suffix')"
  },

    }
  ],
  "examples_sentence": [
    {
      "english": "English example sentence (OCR result may need verification)",
      "chinese": "Chinese translation (OCR result may need verification)"
    }
  ]
}
Additional Instructions:

Always use the entire OCR context to fill each field.
Flag or annotate any field where the OCR results might be uncertain.
Follow the structure exactly and ensure all optional fields (like derivatives) are returned as empty arrays if no data is available.
